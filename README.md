# Svelte NASA-APOD-API

[NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/) provides a lot of cool and fun to use APIs. I chose the simple yet super cool APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API. NASA provides a new picture with a title, explanation and more additional info every day since 16. June 1995. __Thank you, NASA__ ❤️. 

### Setup and serve
After forking this repo or just downloading the code, run `npm i` in the command line after you changed to this directory.
Now a new folder named __node_modules__ should be appeared in the project. If you now want to serve the web app local just run `npm run dev` and open your favorite browser at `localhost:5000`.
